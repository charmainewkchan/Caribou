# Bixr

https://bixr.herokuapp.com/

We created Bixr to improve the Bicker process at Princeton. The point of bicker is to help upperclassmen get to know underclassmen so that they can decide whether or not they want the underclassmen in their club. The process can be stressful and we thought that there should be a better way to meet people. Bixr helps students meet each other throughout the year and allows them to participate in activities they actually enjoy. Our website allows students to host and join events so that they can get to know each other before bicker actually happens.

In this project we use React, Bootstrap, Django, and Postgres.
