Currently, bicker is a 3 days process where students try to meet as many members as they can so that members can decide whether or not they want to let them into the club. The basic idea behind this is for students to meet other students. We believe this can be improved by extending this process (therefore making it less intensive) and by making it more spontaneous. We want to connect students before bicker so that they have a chance to meet upper/underclassmen in a more realistic and less time-constrained setting. We will accomplish this by creating a website for students to host and join different “events”. We hope that these events will foster community and encourage students to connect with others students.
